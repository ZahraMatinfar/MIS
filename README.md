# MIS
MIS is stand for maximal independent set.
This code  implements a simple algorithm to find all MIS s in a graph by using boolean Algebra.
The code generates output  for 1 to 18 nodes correctly and in a reasonable time.
The idea comes from this article: https://www.themathcitadel.com/using-boolean-algebra-to-find-all-maximal-independent-sets-in-a-graph/
